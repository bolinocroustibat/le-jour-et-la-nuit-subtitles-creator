1
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,477
Enough!

2
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,796
Poor devil.

3
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,633
Luckily he had time to pay.

4
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,398
Better go, they'll blame me anyway.

5
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,200
The evening train?

6
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,951
Of course. Money moves in the shadows.

7
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,072
Enough. I called the police.

8
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,600
But we're colleagues!

9
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,393
Get going!

10
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,590
Terrorist!

11
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
Please come in.
I regret the trouble.

12
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,319
Fine cauliflowers.

13
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,752
I'd like this one.

14
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,430
Marcel?

15
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,635
You little gangster.

16
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,752
Oh Yvette, you were in.

17
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,238
Your bill's long
like the Congo River.

18
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,315
I'm your best customer.

19
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,234
When will you pay?

20
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,159
When I inherit. But don't tell my wife.

21
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm the man of the house. Excuse me.

22
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,998
- Closed.
- I see your feet.

23
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,271
Impossible, I'm upstairs.

24
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,630
I'd buy something.

25
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,910
Good night!

26
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,950
Evening, Laika.

27
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,835
I'm home.

28
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,635
I notice that.

29
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,958
You've been busy today.

30
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,278
It's my nature.
I don't know how to be idle.

31
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,637
I'll prepare the dinner

32
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,678
but you've time for an aperitif.

33
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,236
Don't spend it all.

34
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
I'll take the dog.

35
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,190
She can carry the change home.

36
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,351
His name's Gérard Lenormand,

37
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,755
not Lebreton.

38
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,949
Amusing. You talk about a name,
but it's a culture.

39
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,517
- Brittany is a culture.
- No.

40
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,790
What culture?

41
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,993
You think Mont Saint-Michel
is in Brittany.

42
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,396
It is in Brittany.

43
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,875
It's Le Couesnon.

44
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,560
It's a fact.

45
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,435
You know, back home in Alsace.

46
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,677
Enough about Alsace.

47
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,439
Fine ducks there.

48
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,154
What you talking about?

49
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,835
That's heresy!

50
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,074
I'll go earn my pension.

51
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,193
Really tough to wake up at 4 am.

52
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,355
A pleasant fellow.

53
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,829
How's Arletty?

54
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,317
Fine. She's preparing dinner
and drove me out.

55
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,195
You don't deserve such a good wife.

56
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,834
You're not worth her.

57
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,237
No one is, so I'll do.

58
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,674
She's protective

59
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,156
and couldn't watch me lie in the gutter,

60
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,840
a man in his prime.

61
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,277
Foreigners see bums

62
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,520
in a considerably
more romantic light

63
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,200
than we French.

64
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,394
You're not too polite.

65
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,592
Her first husband was violent

66
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,069
and an athlete.

67
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,760
Care for another?

68
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,153
There's still time for one.

69
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,480
<i>You're listening to Reality Radio:</i>
<i>Difficult Choices.</i>

77

Won't you eat?

78
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,237
I visited Florence today.

79
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,557
She had a pot of cassoulet.

80
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,115
- What is it?
- More living dead.

81
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,038
The container was shipped
three weeks ago

82
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,794
from Libreville in Gabon

83
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,756
to London.

84
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,792
Was supposed to take five days.

85
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
Been here two days.

86
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,473
- A computer error.
- Probably in Paris.

87
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,759
Inspector Monet, Le Havre.

88
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,071
You heard voices inside?

89
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,000
More like a child crying.

90
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,440
Baltic Queen.

91
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,869
Wasn't she scrapped?

92
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,719
This is number two.

93
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,434
Former Honolulu Star.

94
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,276
What d'you think?

95
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,277
If they've had water and oxygen,
with luck...

96
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,960
Is that necessary?

97
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,031
Ministry of Interior's orders.

98
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,349
The Red Cross.

99
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,552
How are you, Madam?

100
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,593
And the child?

101
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,149
Tired.

102
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,714
Are you mad? A child.

103
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,279
<i>ONE OF THE CONTAINER REFUGEES</i>
<i>ON THE RUN</i>

<i>ARMED AND DANGEROUS?</i>
<i>CONNECTIONS TO AL-GAEDA?</i>

105
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,679
Salut, Marcel, ça va?

106
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,395
- Caught any?
- No. Dry as the Gobi.

107
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,398
Eskimos have robbed everything.

108
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,320
Greedy devils.

109
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,717
See you later.

110
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,155
Is this London?

111
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,397
You want there? The other side.

112
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,040
This is Le Havre, in Normandy.

113
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,950
Are you hungry?

114
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,956
Get up here.

115
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,389
Could be a pensioner's Metro card.

116
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,240
No Metro in Le Havre. Papers.

117
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,600
A black boy

118
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,513
has been seen here.

119
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,711
He needs care.

120
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,356
So you always say.

121
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,152
I've seen no one.

122
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,070
Beat it.

123
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,033
Don't forget your lunch.

124

<i>This morning, ruthlessly</i>

00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,436
<i>Migrants regrouped behind banderols.</i>

<i>No Border activists and the police</i>

<i>This morning</i>

<i>Many of those arrested</i>

What do you think?

147
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,590
Hard to say, for I don't exist.

148
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,476
Who's he?

149
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,914
That's you, Chang.

150
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,592
I'm not Chang, not from China
but from Vietnam.

151
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,230
Came here 12 years ago atop a train.

152
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,279
Paid eight years for an identity
in the databases.

153
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,480
I can enjoy social security

154
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,558
and vote, if I want to.

155
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,400
I support my family,

156
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,590
I'm a happy man.

157
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,677
But I'm not him.

You can call me Chang, I'm used to it.

Mediterranean has more

160

It's harder to deport a nameless person.

- Jeanne.

163
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,593
A sandwich and water.

164
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,077
Water?

165
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,436
It's not for me.

166
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,717
I understand.

167
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,120
What is it? Wait.

168
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,316
Marcel.

169
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,239
Turn off the stove.

170
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,916
What's wrong?

171
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,760
You weren't in the bar.

172
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,997
No one knew where you were.

173
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,873
I'll get an ambulance.

174
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,235
Don't be long.

175
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,511
Yvette!

176
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,077
What is it?

177
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,280
May I use the phone?

178
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,433
Arletty must go to the hospital.

179
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,274
I'll take you.

180
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,235
I'll just get my coat.

181
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,678
The husband of Arletty Marx?

182
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,631
Yes.

183
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,720
She sleeps, we gave her pain-killers.

184
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,513
You can go home.

185
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,276
Return when we get the results.

186
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,596
I'd like to wait.

187
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,792
That'd be no use.

188
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,912
You'd just be in the way.

189
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,079
Take my card.

190
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,237
Thank you.

191
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,036
Good morning, Yvette.

192
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,317
How's Arletty? What did they say?

193
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,510
She sleeps.

194
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,112
I go back in the afternoon.

195
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,356
Shall I come?

196
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,831
I'll be alright.
Perhaps they'll let her come home.

197
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,110
Perhaps.

198
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,997
Laika?

199
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,079
Came to pay your debt?

200
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,476
You have a name?

201
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,551
Speak.

202
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,151
Idrissa.

203
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,520
Quo vadis, Idrissa?

204
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,471
What?

205
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,877
- Where are you going?
- London.

206
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,596
What's there?

207
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,832
You know the way?

208
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,996
We'll talk later.
I must go, but I'll be back.

209
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,431
You can sleep on the couch.

210
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,916
Don't go out, don't open the door.

211
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,397
Understand?

212
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,556
Yes, Sir.

213
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,117
So there's no hope?

214
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,559
Miracles do happen.

215
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,513
Not in my neighbourhood.

216
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,518
Please don't tell the truth
to my husband.

217
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,949
Embellish it.

218
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,597
He's just a big child.

219
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,679
It's against the rules.

220
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,474
I beg you.

221
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,519
Tell him...

222
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,110
later.

223
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,514
The rules don't say when you must tell.

224
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,636
Alright.

225
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,919
I'll talk like a politician.

226
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,030
We'll begin the treatments next week.

227
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,991
Be brave.

228
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,679
I was too categorical.

229
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,713
There's always hope.

230
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,870
Doctor.

231
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,550
Come to see me later.

232
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,080
Yes, Dr Becker.

233
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,715
I didn't bring any food.

234
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,718
- How are you?
- Much better.

235
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,195
I almost got worried.

236
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,398
I'm away for a moment
and you start spending.

237
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,240
I got them cheap, they were on sale.

238
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,715
What am I saying?

239
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,800
I bought the most expensive ones.

240
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,912
Will you come home soon?

241
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,716
I'll take care of you.

242
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,320
I must stay, perhaps a long time.

243
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,512
The doctor will explain.

244
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,756
Let's talk about other things.

245
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,400
Thank God it's benign.

246
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,154
No danger then.

247
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,800
That's what the doctor said.
Evidently extremely benign.

248
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,878
Still, they won't let her home.

249
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,317
They want to be certain.

250
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,680
Care for another?

251
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,071
No, thanks.

252
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,350
On the house.

253
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,040
In that case, gladly.

254
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,479
I'll visit her tomorrow.

255
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,954
You remember the ward?

256
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,674
Thirteen, same as the room.

257
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,076
I'll go in the morning, too.
Santé!

258
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,231
Thank you.

259
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,234
Are you mad? You don't listen at all.

260
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,591
No wonder they put you on the ship.

261
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,392
Sorry.

262
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,674
If caught, you won't get to London
but back where you left from.

263
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,395
You want that?

264
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,431
No.

265
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,232
I need time to help you.

266
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,357
Central Police Station?

267
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,112
I believe I have
some information for you.

268
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,716
Are you hungry?

269
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,077
Did you eat anything?

270
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,316
Yes.

271
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,239
- Want some water?
- No.

272
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,514
I take a glass sometimes.

273
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,393
Does you good

274
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,920
and helps you to sleep.

275
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,999
I used to live a Bohemian life in Paris.

276
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,195
My success was artistic only.

277
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,314
We could drink a lot
if we had a cause to celebrate.

278
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,274
You don't understand?

279
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,198
No, Sir.

280
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,875
Don't call me Sir.

281
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,592
We haven't been introduced.

282
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,393
My, my. A civilized family.

283
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,116
Father was a teacher.

284
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,631
Marcel Marx. Call me Marcel.

285
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,437
<i>Oui, mon Général.</i>

286
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,630
I'll step out, then we'll continue.

287
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,840
Into the bedroom.

288
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,956
Evening, Yvette.

289
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,992
I brought some food.

290
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,520
I'm not hungry.

291
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,951
But someone inside might be.

292
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,956
A one-egg omelette nature
and a small red wine.

293
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,519
Right away, Mr. Marx.

294
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,272
Mind if I join you?

295
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,870
Nothing could please me more.

296
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,351
Domaine de Courbissac, 2005.

297
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,078
You live alone, Mr. Marx?

298
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,240
With my wife. Why?

299
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,674
She's in hospital?

300
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,517
Leave my wife alone and go.

301
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,712
What a temper.

302
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,680
Prefer to talk at the station?

303
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,751
On what grounds? My permit's fine.

304
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,871
As your tax declaration, I'm sure.

305
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,560
You misunderstand me.

306
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,751
I came as a friend, to warn you.

307
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,757
About what?

308
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,478
Your neighbour, for example.

309
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,035
I investigate crimes,
not taxes or immigration.

310
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,677
Understand?

311
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,310
Good day.

312
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,593
Marcel! Wait!

313
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,236
Thank you, Yvette.

314
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,754
Could you hide the boy if necessary?

315
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,314
Of course, gladly.

316
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,590
Don't tell anyone.

317
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,234
Of course not.
What do you...

318
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,476
Mr. Marx!

319
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,596
Come here.

320
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,840
I've sometimes been rude,

321
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,680
but times are hard.

322
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,713
I have groceries going old

323
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,840
and I thought of you.

324
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,631
Sit down.

325
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,920
I need names. Who are your parents?

326
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,680
Where do you come from?

327
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,879
Start from the beginning.

328
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,030
Do you know Mahamat Saleh's family?

329
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,518
Go over there.

330
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,714
I'll write down instructions for you.

331
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,111
Finish the polish with a cloth.

332
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:06,958
This one?

333
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,719
Yes. And do it well.

334
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,274
I need them tonight.

335
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,878
There are better professions

336
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,199
but besides shepherd's,
it's closest to people.

337
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,276
And the last to respect
the Sermon on the Mount.

338
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,952
Put a leash on Laika.

339
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,520
Will you take him? I'm off to Calais.

340
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,473
- How long?
- A few days.

341
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,672
Don't let the boy out.

342
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,839
Buy him some clothes
and make him take a shower.

343
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,635
Don't worry.

344
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,910
Thanks, Yvette.

345
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,511
I have important things to do.

346
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,197
I can't come tomorrow.
I'll tell you later.

347
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,516
Stay brave.

348
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,798
Your taxi will be here soon.

349
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,117
There's a camp on the shore
off Dunkirk.

350
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,231
I know.

351
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,795
- Do you know Mahamat Saleh?
- Talk to him.

352
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,640
May I disturb you?

353
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,435
Got a cigarette?

354
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,716
Sure.

355
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,477
- Want to eat?
- Thank you.

356
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,750
I'm looking for Mahamat Saleh.
I heard he'd be here.

357
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,156
Who told you?

358
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,033
His compatriots in Le Havre.

359
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,950
For what reason?

360
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,515
For his grandson.

361
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,313
Why should I believe you?

362
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,433
Because of my blue eyes.

363
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,634
He's not here.
He was taken to a refugee centre.

364
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,830
Which one?

365
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,560
The one here, in Calais.

366
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,710
His brother! Are you mocking me?

367
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,512
I'm the family albino.

368
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,633
And to your misfortune,
a journalist and a lawyer.

369
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,479
Discrimination based on the colour...

370
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,037
I never...

371
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,839
Don't make it worse.

372
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,280
I recorded everything.

373
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,995
- Fetch Mahamat Salem.
- Yes, Director.

374
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,232
The boy's mother has been
in London for a year already.

375
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,877
She has no residence permit

376
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,837
but a good job in a Chinese laundry.

377
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,395
The address is:

378
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,640
Whitechapel Road 248, at the back.

379
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,918
- Remember?
- I'll write it down.

380
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,840
My son was going to follow
her soon with Idrissa

381
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,430
but...

382
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,634
He was...

383
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,956
He died.

384
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,760
And what will you do?

385
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,590
The jar returns to the well
until it breaks.

386
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,078
I'm an old man anyway.

387
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,994
But if you can...

388
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,120
I give you my word.

389
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,232
I'm not alone. I've friends.

390
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,235
Please let me know.

391
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,675
Don't let them deport the boy.

392
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,156
I won't.

393
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,159
A wonderful child. Full of life and joy.

394
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,670
My cousin has a daughter

395
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,111
with a man

396
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,154
but they're not married.

397
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,630
Our family had a similar tragedy

398
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,354
in the fifties.

399
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,990
Isn't it wonderful that two
young people love each other?

400
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,920
Why should the society dictate

401
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,600
what's right or wrong?

402
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,874
Police?

403
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,951
The boy is at the railway station.

404
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,512
- Stay there.
- Let me go!

405
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,520
Wait peacefully.

406
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,069
The police are coming.

407
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,719
- Run!
- Listen, you!

408
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,798
You'll be in trouble.

409
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,714
Idrissa has disappeared.

410
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,032
- I checked your home, too.
- When?

411
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,351
This morning. I was in my shop.

412
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,677
Calm down. I'll find him.

413
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,036
Good afternoon, Laika.
Where's Idrissa?

414
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,993
- You been crying?
- No.

415
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,272
Good. It won't help.

416
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,277
Greetings from your grandfather.

417
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,270
He's well and told you to obey me.

418
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,870
He stressed that.

419
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,316
One moment.

420
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,510
Enter.

421
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,236
Marcel,

422
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,873
you mustn't see me like this.

423
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,911
Like what?

424
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,918
So thin and ugly.

425
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,396
You've said you hate thin women.

426
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,240
Ones who don't appreciate food.

427
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,193
Thin is even better.

428
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,311
How come?

429
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,036
For example, clothes take less fabric.

430
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,835
In a small car, you've room for more.

431
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,072
So you'd like more wives?

432
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,993
You want to misunderstand me.

433
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,795
Chocolate?

434
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,871
There you see.

435
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,633
You're truthful? It's not serious?

436
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,353
I wouldn't deceive you.

437
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,510
If you say so.

438
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,990
More than that.

439
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,680
I promise.

440
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,989
But now the treatments begin
and I must be alone.

441
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,998
I must not see anyone.

442
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,236
Not even me?

443
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,194
Especially not you.

444
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,557
You upset my equilibrium.

445
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,836
Would that be bad?

446
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,476
Extremely bad.

447
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,158
Come back in two weeks.

448
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,112
And when you come,
bring me my yellow dress.

449
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,551
The one I wore in La Rochelle.

450
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,680
Remember?

451
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,510
I remember.

452
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,279
But according to St. Matthew 12.

453
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,918
We're not unanimous.

454
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,432
St. Luke says
the kingdom of heaven is happy

455
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,998
and the gates open for the innocent.

456
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,556
But Christ returned onto Earth.

457
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,279
Good afternoon, Inspector.

458
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,954
Good afternoon, Mr. Prefect.

459
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,355
Please sit down.

460
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,240
The press follows this case closely.

461
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,479
It is imperative
that we progress quickly.

462
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,034
Yes, Mr. Prefect.

463
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,039
You have a long career.

464
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,470
Very long.

465
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,880
You are our best crime investigator.

466
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,034
Deliver the boy to the authorities.

467
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,039
The sooner, the better. For all of us.

468
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,151
I understand, Mr. Prefect.

469
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,600
Goodbye, Mr. Prefect.

470
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,270
Go inside.

471
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,999
A certain Marcel Marx lives nearby.

472
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,280
Tell me about him.

473
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,399
With pleasure. One of my best customers.

474
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,114
Regular as clockwork.

475
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,314
Won't let an unpaid bill keep him awake.

476
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,954
Wife in the hospital?

477
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,039
Yes. Poor woman.
I heard there's no hope.

478
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,999
How does Marx take it?

479
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,833
Crushed. Puts on a brave face.

480
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,113
Anyone else with him?

481
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,352
No one. Just a dog. Poor beast.

482
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,153
Misses her mistress.

483
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,999
Thank you.

484
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,159
I only did my duty. I love the society.

485
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,475
Won't you buy something

486
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,955
Inspector?

487
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,230
A pineapple.

488
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,280
A pineapple it is.

489
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,831
A calvados.

490
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,631
Leave.

491
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,473
Evening, Henri.

492
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,915
For me?

493
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,550
No.

494
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,800
I heard about your husband.

495
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,195
My condolences.

496
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,110
Why?

497
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,989
He was a fatalist.

498
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,998
I put him behind bars.

499
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,239
That's what cops do.

500
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,396
He would've died anyway.

501
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,674
What do you want?

502
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,440
Marcel Marx. You care about him?

503
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,076
Yes.

504
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,470
Very much.

505
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,553
<i>In the distance</i>
<i>a train rolled into view.</i>

506
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,672
<i>All compartments were lit,</i>

507
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,519
<i>the windows cranked down.</i>

508
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,111
<i>We began to sing a ditty,</i>
<i>we all wanted to sing.</i>

509
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,880
<i>We sang faster than the train ran.</i>

510
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,834
<i>We waved our arms,</i>
<i>voices were not enough,</i>

511
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,676
<i>we ended up in a pleasant throng</i>
<i>with our voices.</i>

512
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,997
<i>When your voice mixes with others,</i>

513
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,350
<i>you're hooked.</i>

514
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,640
<i>We sang into the ears</i>
<i>of the distant passengers.</i>

515
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,153
<i>Grown-ups were still awake,</i>
<i>mothers prepared beds.</i>

516
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,510
<i>We had to hurry.</i>

517
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,112
<i>I kissed the one next to me,</i>

518
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,392
<i>offered my hand to the nearest three.</i>

519
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,833
<i>I began to run back along the road,</i>
<i>no one called after me.</i>

520
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,835
<i>When they could see me no more</i>

521
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,874
<i>I turned and ran along the farm roads,</i>

522
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,434
<i>into the forest again.</i>

523
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,629
<i>I went south towards the town</i>
<i>of which we said:</i>

524
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,836
<i>"Strange people live there!</i>
<i>They don't sleep!"</i>

525
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,394
<i>"Why not?"</i>

526
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,353
<i>"They don't grow tired."</i>

527
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,676
<i>"Why not?"</i>

528
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,234
<i>"Because they are mad."</i>

529
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,636
<i>"Don't mad people grow tired?"</i>

530
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,629
<i>"How could the mad grow tired?"</i>

531
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,395
She's asleep.

532
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,990
My cousin's brother-in-law will do it.

533
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,074
We could swap cargoes

534
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,079
in international waters.

535
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,234
But it's expensive,

536
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,556
the risk is big.

537
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,877
The boat may be confiscated.

538
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,200
For us, it's enough if you pay the fuel.

539
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,800
And the Englishman?

540
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,595
3,000 Euros.

541
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,759
I'll get the money

542
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,240
but I need a bit of time.

543
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,997
Thanks, Francis. I won't forget this.

544
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,714
An enormous sum.

545
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,319
I've saved up some.

546
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,076
Yvette doesn't deserve to inherit.

547
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,670
She's so reckless.

548
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,238
To open up a bakery
during times like these.

549
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,160
I've saved up 200

550
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,875
for my daughter's bike. It can wait.

551
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,799
She's only two weeks old.

552
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,834
Thank you, but I really couldn't.

553
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,795
I'll have to manage.

554
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,479
Arrange a charity concert.
It's very trendy.

555
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,353
But I can't play at all.

556
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,677
- Hire Little Bob.
- Impossible.

557
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,996
Why?

558
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,999
He won't play until Mimie returns.

559
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,509
Has Mimie left?

560
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,473
Yes. They had a row.

561
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,034
About what?

562
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,233
Gardening. An apple tree, apparently.

563
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,719
How long has she been gone?

564
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,360
Three weeks now.

565
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,519
Where can I find this Mimie?

566
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,875
Alright, if Roberto apologizes.

567
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,034
Thank you, Jacquotte.

568
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,714
I know you've had differences
with your wife.

569
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,516
But I'd like to arrange
a trendy charity concert

570
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,951
with your help.

571
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,438
Only if Mimie comes back.

572
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,876
Without her, my voice lacks substance.

573
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,159
She's the road manager of my soul.

574
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,113
What did you argue about?

575
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,035
It was insignificant.

576
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,357
But she must understand
who's the man of the house.

577
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,119
It can't be her.

578
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,713
What if I can persuade her to come back?

579
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,991
I could dance a minuet.

580
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,956
Mimie.

581
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,355
Oh, Roberto.

582
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,918
<i>The Return of Little Bob</i>

583
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,673
- Hi, Idrissa.
- Mr. Chang.

584
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,916
We're waiting.

585
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,236
What do you mean?

586
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,875
The concert begins in four hours.

587
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,116
What concert?

588
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,550
Are you drunk?

589
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,590
The Little Bob concert you arranged.

590
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,794
But it's tomorrow.

591
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,631
According to the poster,
band and audience, today.

592
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,391
Shit.

593
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,076
Idrissa.

594
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,075
Take this to my wife in hospital.
Her name's Arletty.

595
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,431
Tell her I'll come tomorrow.

596
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,717
Listen carefully,
I'll explain how you get there.

597
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,197
- Can I help you?
- Room 13?

598
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,675
End of the hall.

599
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,199
Come in. Looking for me?

600
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,519
Are you Mrs. Arletty?

601
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,397
It's from Mr. Marx.

602
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,911
He can't come today,
he'll come tomorrow.

603
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,196
And who are you, if I may ask?

604
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,351
Idrissa Saleh,
a friend of your husband.

605
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,194
What brought you here?

606
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,035
I came by accident.

607
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,360
Have you known Marcel for long?

608
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,836
No. Just a couple of weeks.

609
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,031
Madam.

610
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,037
Yes?

611
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,039
Try to get well soon.

612
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,835
Mr. Marx won't manage without you.

613
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,039
I think so, too.

614
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,151
Madam.

615
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,711
Goodbye.

616
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,070
And good luck.

617
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,116
Goodbye. To you, too.

618
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,396
Thank you.

619
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,554
You'd better go.

620
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,872
Inspector Monet, what a surprise.

621
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,196
And this early.

622
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,800
It's my nature.

623
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,316
May I come in?

624
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,956
By all means.

625
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,600
The dark side of my work is
that people don't like us.

626
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,077
People scream for us to help.

627
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,278
But are they grateful?

628
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,677
Not a bit.

629
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,313
It doesn't really bother me.

630
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,116
I don't much like people.

631
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,469
But it seems to disturb my colleagues

632
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,679
especially the younger ones.

633
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,555
It may be hard to believe

634
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,996
that my heart has its tender spots.

635
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,191
I'm ruthless towards genuine malefactors

636
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,353
but I don't like to see the innocent suffer.

637
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,036
Not you. You're not innocent.

638
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,311
And have never been.

639
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,273
That is true.

640
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,393
Naturally,
I'm here completely unofficially

641
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,752
and I thank you for inviting me in.

642
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,792
A nasty wind blows outside.

643
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,955
And I couldn't give you advice

644
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,720
without committing a breach of duty.

645
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,070
Naturally.

646
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,920
So, we agree.

647
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,954
On my day off, and as your friend

648
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,833
permit me to think aloud.

649
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,554
Here, it's your privilege.

650
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,878
If I were you,
you find that repulsive...

651
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,434
On the contrary.

652
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,559
Don't exaggerate.

653
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,549
If I practised smuggling,

654
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,360
this is just hypothetical,

655
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,834
and I had a precious parcel
the border police should not get,

656
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,558
they deal with smuggling
and illegal immigration.

657
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,791
Your hypothesis is interesting.

658
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,279
So if I were you

659
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,794
I'd get rid of the parcel

660
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,438
as soon as possible.

661
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,276
Goodbye.

662
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,035
Gauthier, Goupil, Hébert, the street.

663
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,515
The rest, follow me.

664
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,156
Stay there.

665
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,360
Madam, we'll check the premises.

666
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,914
Go ahead, gentlemen.

667
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,400
We'll check the premises.

668
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,512
Talk to my wife.

669
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,358
With pleasure, young man.

670
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:39,871
Good morning.

671
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,914
Good morning, Jean-Pierre.

672
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:00,437
True. It goes well with scallops.

673
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,997
Yes, but you have to shell them

674
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,590
and make the sauce and everything.

675
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,112
Right, I won't make scallops.

676
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,550
They follow you.

677
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,390
I know.

678
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,277
Is the boy safe?

679
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,870
Hope so. God willing, he leaves today.

680
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,197
A white.

681
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,232
May I go out the back?

682
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,677
Lock the door, Luc.

683
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,955
Go.

684
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,590
- Cauliflowers!
- Sold out.

685
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,799
Go and sell your stuff to the rich!

686
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,150
I'm sorry.

687
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,199
What a greengrocer!

688
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,630
Liar!

689
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,354
My husband'll kill me.

690
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,155
Have a nice voyage.

691
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,352
Get going, Chang!

692
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,555
Thank you. I won't forget you.

693
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,716
Nor will I you.

694
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,559
Greet your wife for me.

695
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,397
Take this.

696
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,274
Your mother's address.

697
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,756
Thanks, Francis.

698
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,356
- You dirty...
- Don't make it worse.

699
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:28,796
Do you smoke?

700
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,392
Move aside.

701
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,520
The hold is empty.

702
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,590
I've my orders.

703
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,234
You question my authority, officer?

704
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,916
No, Inspector.

705
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,873
You may go.

706
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,752
I was mistaken about you.

707
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,835
May I apologize with a drink?

708
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,916
Why not.
Perhaps a calvados.

709
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,598
Follow me, Mr. Marx.

710
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,196
You can pick up her things later.

711
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,514
Corinne, take him to Dr. Becker.

712
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,597
Right.

713
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,798
I'm sorry, Mr. Marx,
I don't know what happened.

714
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,151
Medicine knows nothing like this.

715
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,716
Everything pointed at the opposite.

716
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,550
I heard about a patient in Shanghai

717
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,877
who had healed in seconds...

718
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,999
but here in France...

719
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,753
I'm cured.

720
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,270
The disease is gone.

721
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,790
Let's go home, Marcel.

722
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,199
Look, Marcel.

723
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,796
The cherry tree blooms.

724
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,119
I'll make dinner right away.

725
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,797

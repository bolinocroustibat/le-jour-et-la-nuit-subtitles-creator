0
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
Come on, release, there, oh

1
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
Laure, but where are you going?

2
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
But you're not going to start again?

3
00:04:14 --> 00:04:14
LAURE!

4
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
Anyway, I'm for the little one with the green shirt

5
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
And we can know why?

6
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
Because the other looks like, you did not notice?

7
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Why are you so nasty?

8
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
And in addition you are wrong, it's cui in white that will win

9
00:04:37 --> 00:04:37
Take !

10
00:04:40 --> 00:04:40
Oh !

11
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
But you have to stop them!

12
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
Wait! It's enough!

13
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
Come on, a small review to change the ideas.

14
00:05:23 --> 00:05:30
And then, this book I know him by heart.You made me repeated a hundred times from Paris.

15
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
Oh no !You know that heroin does not smoke!

16
00:05:33 --> 00:05:33
inaudible

17
00:05:36 --> 00:05:37
Hold.Read that.The.

18
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
So that's there?

19
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
It's not possible.We had to be wrong.

20
00:06:53 --> 00:06:53
Sir !

21
00:06:55 --> 00:07:01
Ola Roven!Are we good at the writer Alexandre Calf ...

22
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
You do not tire, he is deaf!

23
00:07:03 --> 00:07:11
Ah.I am Filippi.Raoul Filippi.The producer !With Laure, the actress!
We come for the movie.

24
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
I know.We received your letters.

25
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
Ah, he's here!Mr. Alexandre!Mr. Alexandre!

26
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
Filippi!From Paris !With Laure!

27
00:07:29 --> 00:07:35
I should welcome you, but there's a seawind that pushes me west

28
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
Do not worry, we will manage!

29
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
What are you saying ?I do not hear you

30
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
I say we will manage

31
00:07:44 --> 00:07:45
I do not hear you

32
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
We'll get by !

33
00:07:50 --> 00:07:55
That's right, we are better in the sky.Much better

34
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
See you later !

35
00:08:04 --> 00:08:04
Well

36
00:08:06 --> 00:08:06
Luggage

37
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
What did you do with it?

38
00:08:18 --> 00:08:18
Tell me

39
00:08:21 --> 00:08:21
Gift

40
00:08:26 --> 00:08:26
Wait

41
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
I will help you

42
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
I beg you, do not laugh in addition, there's nothing funny.

43
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
No, but I'll help you, give me that.

44
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
That's it, take a bag!

45
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
Give me the.

46
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
It's a lot too heavy for you!

47
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
Filippi, let me help you.

48
00:09:45 --> 00:09:50
Relax Filippi, everything is fine.I'm so moved here

49
00:09:51 --> 00:09:52
Pff, and shit

50
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
Basically, you never really said to me.

51
00:09:57 --> 00:10:11
But if !I told you 100 times!It is very happy that it is, simply this guy lives exiled here for 10 years, off-circuit.He knows more who is who in Paris

52
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
10 years old, already ...

53
00:10:10 --> 00:10:10
Pff!

54
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
I feel like it was yesterday.

55
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
Yesterday, what?

56
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
Nothing.Do not try to understand, it's my secret

57
00:10:22 --> 00:10:22
Good!

58
00:10:22 --> 00:10:27
Concentrate instead on what you are going to have to tell him.

59
00:10:26 --> 00:10:39
That's okay!And you, focus on the effect you are going to have to do it.Long dress for yellow lunch and bikini if you go to the beach.

60
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
Where are you going there?

62
00:10:57 --> 00:10:57
Do not move

63
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
After, you suck me?

64
00:11:15 --> 00:11:16
Carlo, my darling

65
00:11:16 --> 00:11:16
Carlo ...

66
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
HM hm.Oh, you are here!I did not tell me anything

67
00:12:04 --> 00:12:15
It does not matter !It allows us to discover the very secret universe of a great artist!We are so impressed.

68
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
We showed you your rooms?

69
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
No, it does not matter, we just arrived!

70
00:12:17 --> 00:12:27
Yes, we may have just arrived but it's been 30 hours we left Paris and I must admit that I have a little thirst.

71
00:12:25 --> 00:12:35
That does not surprise me.[XXX] is like that, she is always like that.There, for example, what do you believe he says sir ...

72
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Filippi, Raoul Filippi.

73
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
And you are Laure, do not you?

74
00:12:40 --> 00:12:40
Yes Madam.

75
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
Help Mr Filippi to carry his luggage

76
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
You allow ?

77
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
Yes, that's it.Exactly that.

78
00:13:11 --> 00:13:17
Do not be afraid, young woman you will hold the role.Never be afraid.

79
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
Who is this lady ?

80
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
Madame Blanch, Sonia Blanch.

81
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
Well, she does not look very mexican.

82
00:13:30 --> 00:13:44
Madame Blanch is American but she especially lived in Paris.Now we live the great mason on the course and then we often visit Mr. Alexandre.

83
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
And yourself ?

84
00:13:38 --> 00:13:47
I am the housekeeper of Madame [Blench].I know we are asked to put order in this house.

85
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
I prepared you a surprise for misunderstanding.

86
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
Do not tell me it's still a chocolate volcano.

87
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
If you do not like volcanoes.

88
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
Where is the surprise, the popo?

89
00:14:21 --> 00:14:29
Fend for yourself.She said "I want a poposal eruption", for once she wants something.

90
00:17:05 --> 00:17:11
Here I am !I did not do you too careful?Let's drink to this poor and beautiful country.

91
00:17:11 --> 00:17:17
You are beautiful.What a pity we no longer have the right to photograph you.

92
00:17:17 --> 00:17:39
Rest assured, he will get back on!Well obliged.No, I mean the movie but the paparazzi, festivals, magazines.I still allowed you to bring you this small gift from Paris.Ah, we remember you in Paris.We remember your exploits!

93
00:17:35 --> 00:17:36
Where is she ?

94
00:17:36 --> 00:17:53
Yes, that's right, where does she still spent?It's always the same with actresses.They do not think to show up and at the best time they are hiding!Laure is the moment!

95
00:17:50 --> 00:17:55
LAURE!My little crustacea!Shit !LAURE!Go come now!

96
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
You have seen ?She walks like in the novel.

97
00:18:50 --> 00:18:53
Put it.Mexico's sun is ruthless

98
00:18:55 --> 00:18:58
It's good.I like the sun me too.

99
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
It must be fun there?

100
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
It's strange, I do not really recognize him and yet it's him.

101
00:19:19 --> 00:19:21
It must be very fun there?

102
00:19:21 --> 00:19:22
Very funny !

103
00:19:24 --> 00:19:26
You do not have dizzy?

104
08:06:00 --> 08:06:00
Every time.

105
00:19:30 --> 00:19:32
How do you find the actress?

106
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
Less well than on the photos.

107
00:19:35 --> 00:19:38
You're wrong I find it exciting.

108
00:19:37 --> 00:19:54
Arianne: My wife, and Carlo, Hin Hin.A funny carlo type, but a real scholar: earthquake, tidal wave, volcano, exactly the opposite of me.The more I go up, the more he goes down, what funny job.

109
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
Oh, look like it is wrapped.How long does he fucked you more?

110
00:19:56 --> 00:19:56
Shut your mouth.

111
00:19:57 --> 00:20:00
Go ahead tell me.One year, two years, three years?

112
00:19:59 --> 00:20:01
I beg you Carlo shut up.

113
00:20:03 --> 00:20:12
Ah, and then now that's the junk.He should not go out of his house right now, he takes risks.

114
00:20:07 --> 00:20:09
What do you know?

115
00:20:08 --> 00:20:08
I know.

116
00:20:08 --> 00:20:22
It's Cristobal, my Cristobal friend clici, he lives on the other side of the bay, nearby.It's like that.3 pistol strokes when he arrives, 3 shots when he goes away.

117
00:20:18 --> 00:20:19
He is Mexican ?

118
00:20:19 --> 00:20:30
Spanish, former communist, tomorrow singing, clandestine and all the bazaar.And then here in Mexico he has changed a little ... Whatever ...

119
00:20:28 --> 00:20:29
Whatever, what?

120
00:20:29 --> 00:20:42
Ah you know it's funny life.There are so many people here who want him.And it's home that he feels most out of shelter.And that makes me happy.

121
00:21:03 --> 00:21:07
The ideal, do not you miss Laure, it was Ava Gardner.

122
00:21:07 --> 00:21:11
Ava Gardner was ideal for all roles.

123
00:21:09 --> 00:21:30
Ahh, I knew Ava Gardner, I even think I wanted to marry her.Ahh, first she did not like my boat, and then we had to tell him that I always asked women with whom I had not slept.About, she does not want to get married with me.

124
00:21:27 --> 00:21:30
It's him that you should put in a movie.

125
00:21:31 --> 00:21:44
Oh no maestro, what I want is to be in one of your novels.He promised me.A novel of this man there, you become a saint!It's better than a body guard [xxx]

126
00:21:46 --> 00:21:55
I'll tell you Alexander, if you make me a character, it's as if you were tearing my criminal record.

127
00:21:51 --> 00:21:53
I can not hear that there

128
00:21:53 --> 00:21:58
What is my little one?Your ears, who hurt you?

129
00:22:01 --> 00:22:01
Cristobal!

130
00:22:05 --> 00:22:11
It's lucky, small, that I want to spoil the feast of Masestro.

131
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
Besides, I think Mr. Filippi wants to tell us a few words.

132
00:22:17 --> 00:22:23
But if Raoul, do not be shy, we all want to hear you.

133
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
You listen to you Filippi.

134
00:22:25 --> 00:23:19
It's very nice thank you.Well, if I am here among you, if you see me if moved, it's more than 10 years that I have a fixed idea.This fixed idea, everyone will tell you, in any case in Paris, it is the very first novel of our friend.This novel, how to say, a little sacred, mysterious, on which its biographers have continued to wonder and to which the cinema has never been able to touch.We shot lots of movies from other Alexander books, and which movies!But that one, the history of this Mathilde who joins Ana Karenine and Andromache at the Pantheon of eternal creatures, he had made a kind of sanctuary where the seventh art was banned.

135
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
He makes too much, he loses his head

136
00:23:11 --> 00:23:20
Well, this novel that has changed the lives of millions and millions of readers, this novel that we have read all.

137
00:23:16 --> 00:23:16
Even me !

138
00:23:17 --> 00:23:18
Continue Filippi.

139
00:23:20 --> 00:23:47
[Start of distant phrase inaudible] The badge honor to entrust me for that -modestly- I offer him a new destiny, this novel, I especially given Laure, for looking at your heroin, watch it your Mathilde.It was you who created it, it was she who made you suffer.She is alive, she comes back to you.

140
00:23:44 --> 00:23:47
Shut up now Filippi that's enough.

141
00:23:46 --> 00:23:51
I have never managed to know if this woman existed or not?

142
00:23:51 --> 00:23:54
Everyone is the question Mr. Cristobal.

143
00:24:29 --> 00:24:30
The Sorpresa Por Favorite

144
00:24:40 --> 00:24:49
You are very strong Filippi.Coming to see an old writer, at the end of the race, and that everyone has forgotten.

145
00:24:49 --> 00:24:55
You joke, since you have disappeared, you have become a legenda!

146
00:24:53 --> 00:25:10
To come to offer him to resuscitate the beings he loved and give them before his eyes, a body, a face, gestures, ah, as is skilled.Only do you know the story of Faust is not it?

147
00:25:11 --> 00:25:12
Of course.

148
00:25:13 --> 00:25:19
You know I suppose it's the story of a man who sells his soul.

149
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
It sells for a soul?

150
00:25:19 --> 00:25:32
It does not have a price.It sells against illusions.The illusion of youth, the illusion of a life that starts again.Very exactly what you offer me deep.

151
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
Do you really believe that the devil looks like Mr. Filippi?

152
00:25:34 --> 00:25:34
Ah ah ah

153
00:25:36 --> 00:26:10
No, no, the devil is not him but that's what around him: the pictures, the money, the youman.And then, even if he is not the devil, this novel is my soul.And something tells me that when we breathe it, we end up paying it, expensive.So, I am tempted, of course, and I thought when I brought you that I was decided and then suddenly I do not know.I need to think again.

154
00:26:22 --> 00:26:23
But everything was settled!

155
00:26:27 --> 00:26:31
Go hurry up!Tell, there is atmosphere here.

156
00:26:34 --> 00:26:38
I have the impression that Cristobal had a visit.

157
00:26:40 --> 00:26:43
Good I have too hot, I'll change myself

158
00:26:47 --> 00:26:52
It does not matter, need vinegar, vinegar, bring vinegar!

159
00:26:50 --> 00:26:51
Let me see that.

160
00:26:51 --> 00:26:56
No, no, but it's nothing, I assure you, it's nothing, it's nothing.

161
00:26:55 --> 00:26:59
Norma, take it into my office and make it coffee

162
00:26:58 --> 00:26:59
In your office?

163
00:26:59 --> 00:27:00
In my office.

164
00:27:00 --> 00:27:03
If I had known I will have let me sting.

165
00:27:05 --> 00:27:10
This girl really knows all the stuff to get noticed.

166
00:27:41 --> 00:27:47
Do you know that, apart from me, no one ever falls into this office.

167
00:27:26 --> 00:27:28
So why did it send me?

168
00:27:49 --> 00:27:56
I do not know, I make an experiment no doubt.But I do not know which one.

169
00:28:00 --> 00:28:06
I thought that at one time or another you would give me an exam.

170
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
The exam it started as soon as I saw you.

171
00:28:15 --> 00:28:19
Tell me, this woman, Mathilde, she loved you no?

172
00:28:24 --> 00:28:27
Let's say she loved the hero of the book.

173
00:28:27 --> 00:28:33
So, why does the hero at the end of the book, offer it to another man?

174
00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
Perhaps he already made experiences.

175
00:28:35 --> 00:28:36
I do not understand.

176
00:28:35 --> 00:28:49
If, there are people who are content to be loved and others who want them to prefer.I wanted Mathilde to prefer me.She did not understand it.I lost it.

177
00:28:52 --> 00:28:54
And what did she become?

178
00:28:54 --> 00:28:56
She married this man.

179
00:28:58 --> 00:28:58
And then ?

180
00:29:00 --> 00:29:08
And then, he had a good taste to die quickly in an aircraft accident and leave him all his fortune.

181
00:29:10 --> 00:29:12
So you ended up?

182
00:29:12 --> 00:29:15
No, finally, yes.In a few kinds.

183
00:29:21 --> 00:29:23
Still your earthquakes.

184
00:29:22 --> 00:29:34
Well for once I'm not alone, look at it: an American expert, he writes exactly the same as me, on the comma.Pchrraoouuu !!

185
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
It looks like it makes you happy.

186
00:29:34 --> 00:29:49
Yes, Ben everyone his specialty, your husband is the books he writes more, I'm the earthquake.It's so exciting, the earthquake that would sweep all that there.

187
00:29:47 --> 00:29:56
Oh I beg you, my darling, what I want is that you take me away from Alexander and all his dinguerie.

188
00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
All start over 0, everything.

189
00:29:59 --> 00:30:01
You can leave you hearing me.

190
00:30:25 --> 00:30:26
Where is she ?

191
00:30:27 --> 00:30:27
Who ?

192
00:30:29 --> 00:30:31
Sorry, Arianne your wife.

193
00:30:31 --> 00:30:54
Ah, in the garden, with Carlo.They are good friends you know.Arianne is fragile, she needs to see people who reassure her and carlo often comes.I even finished with time by giving it a room in the hacienda, it's better so.It's attractive, is not it?

194
00:30:57 --> 00:30:58
Yes, I do not know.

195
00:30:59 --> 00:31:03
Ah if, if, very attractive, and then he is young.

196
00:31:04 --> 00:31:04
Without a doubt.

197
00:31:05 --> 00:31:06
Please ?

198
00:31:07 --> 00:31:08
But no not at all !

199
00:31:08 --> 00:31:23
Yet you like it.Do you know what he said earlier when was the wasp piqué?Wasps know all the stuff.They always choose what's sweeter.

200
00:31:22 --> 00:31:23
Good tell me rather.

201
00:31:24 --> 00:31:24
Yes ?

202
00:31:26 --> 00:31:31
When the heroin goes away, you want to kill it is not it?

203
00:31:30 --> 00:31:37
Yes, since in the novel she receives a bullet in the shoulder.The shoulder ... definitely.

204
 --> 00:00:13
For a long time Mathilde wondered by what mystery this man could not love or let himself be loved without moving in machinations he would be with her victim.

205
00:35:42 --> 00:35:47
So Carlo, where do you come from?Do not do this head there we believe that ...

206
00:35:48 --> 00:35:48
What?

207
00:35:49 --> 00:36:07
Well I do not know, you're at home, I get you fine, you're young and you shoot a foggy mouth.Pay attention you will eventually look like [xxx] of the earth.About, do you always prepare your revolution?

208
00:36:00 --> 00:36:01
In your opinion ?

209
00:36:00 --> 00:36:06
Well, and you still think that the good Indians will make the past table shave?

210
00:36:04 --> 00:36:06
Want to play what there?

211
00:36:05 --> 00:36:12
Very well !And cristobal, it's always the abominable renegade that steals the land of peasants?

212
00:36:10 --> 00:36:12
It's obvious that just the

213
00:36:13 --> 00:36:16
Perfect, and well my old continues!

214
00:36:16 --> 00:36:16
Tell me,

215
00:36:17 --> 00:36:17
Yes

216
00:36:19 --> 00:36:21
The actress, how is it?

217
00:36:22 --> 00:36:25
Ah better!Better.justment we talked about you.

218
00:36:26 --> 00:36:27
Oh, good, and then?

219
00:36:29 --> 00:36:35
Well, I do not understand why but, I have the impression that you like him.

220
00:36:50 --> 00:36:57
You will have to explain me one day what you do all the time [xxx] in the village.

221
00:37:08 --> 00:37:11
You know you're taking risks

222
00:37:13 --> 00:37:14
Risks ?

223
00:37:14 --> 00:37:18
It happened so strange things around this book.

224
00:37:23 --> 00:37:25
I know I'm an actress.

225
00:37:25 --> 00:37:25
Yes.

226
00:37:27 --> 00:37:32
And then, what risk could I take?I have nothing to lose.

227
00:37:32 --> 00:37:37
If you have a life, friends, a man in Paris waiting for you.

228
00:37:37 --> 00:37:43
Many even!Ah ah, but it's the advantage, it makes you completely free.

229
00:37:43 --> 00:37:46
Only one tip, do not go into his game.

230
00:37:55 --> 00:38:03
In fact I will tell you, that's not true.I only like a man for 10 years, but in secret.

231
00:38:10 --> 00:38:18
It's good a bit of air, I get crazy.With this guy who do not even know what he wants.

232
00:38:35 --> 00:38:36
Ola, reforma.

233
00:38:44 --> 00:38:44
No, dies.

234
00:39:01 --> 00:39:01
Gracias.

235
00:39:08 --> 00:39:10
You have seen ? It worked !

236
00:39:11 --> 00:39:16
I just met the village priest, he looked so weird.

237
00:39:14 --> 00:39:18
And look Alexander, it's not beautiful our Alexander?

238
00:39:16 --> 00:39:22
Not like a normal priest, I do not know we would have said a kind of bandit.

239
00:39:20 --> 00:39:33
What do you want it to fuck me?Come on, it's going to be time for the walk and I think that's where I'm going to take the piece.

240
00:39:57 --> 00:40:14
The reader can assume that it is on purpose that day there he did not kill Mathilde but was content to hurt her on the shoulder.No doubt it was offered the illusion that one day or the other would come back to him.

241
00:40:24 --> 00:40:30
I have the impression that it would be more decent than you go up with your husband

242
00:40:29 --> 00:40:36
Ah ah ah, and since when are you concerned about what is adequate and what is not?

243
00:40:31 --> 00:40:36
We had a bizarre conversation earlier, I'll explain.

244
00:40:34 --> 00:40:37
It's you who is weird today.

245
00:40:39 --> 00:40:41
Where is Mr. Filippi?Mr. Filippi?

246
00:40:43 --> 00:41:05
I am coming !Sorry ?Yes, rather confident, huge need of money.Oh he may not refuse a proposal that we do.heard, I'll call you back.Sonia!You are resplanders but I abandon you, I have to join our friend, we have to talk business.

247
00:41:03 --> 00:41:09
Oh, no, no, no, so go up with me and leave Alexander to his wives.

248
00:41:17 --> 00:41:20
It looks like the storm is not far

249
00:41:19 --> 00:41:21
Anyway you are.

250
00:43:19 --> 00:43:19
Ah

251
00:43:23 --> 00:43:25
It was your story of

252
00:43:26 --> 00:43:33
Ourf, it's this Filippi who is very good!It's so nice to have come so far!

253
00:43:32 --> 00:43:33
Tell me, Carlo,

254
00:43:35 --> 00:43:35
Yes

255
00:43:36 --> 00:43:38
I find it weird these days.

256
00:43:38 --> 00:43:40
Ha ha ha.Oh yes it's true !

257
00:43:41 --> 00:43:43
If you had seen him in the village.

258
00:43:43 --> 00:43:43
What ?

259
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
Note, ah, no, he looks happy.Look at him !

260
00:43:51 --> 00:43:53
Since when are you his lover?

261
00:43:52 --> 00:43:52
Sorry ?

262
00:43:54 --> 00:43:59
You are the lover of Ariane so I have been wondering since when?

263
00:43:56 --> 00:43:59
You at least you go straight to the goal.

264
00:43:59 --> 00:44:02
And he is not jealous?

265
00:44:02 --> 00:44:04
Oh, he can never know!

266
00:44:06 --> 00:44:14
On the other hand personally, rest assured I am not the kind of guy to be satisfied with a woman.

267
00:44:21 --> 00:44:23
It's really a sublime country!

268
00:44:23 --> 00:44:30
Pff, yes finally it's completely silly, we go in the opposite direction of our guests.

269
00:44:26 --> 00:44:39
Current question, how many times should I tell you that all the principle is there: that go up, go down, these machines can not go to the left or right.

270
00:44:42 --> 00:44:49
Yes but finally we do not have little let our guests leave like that anywhere!

271
00:44:46 --> 00:44:52
Do not take your bad head, look as we are good, we plan, we plan!

272
00:44:50 --> 00:45:00
Good stop, all that does not amuse me at all.Oh and then I have enough, brand everyone with your balloons, let's go now!

273
00:44:56 --> 00:45:01
Not carlo in any case!Ah!He seems to have a lot of fun!

274
00:44:59 --> 00:45:03
Oh but you do not feel that the storm is happening!

275
00:45:06 --> 00:45:21
Good ... [Message in Spanish Mobile Uno Aora Vahamos Mobile Uno Aora Vahamos XXX] And you Lucien, prepares the cars, I have the impression that we will have to go for this con de Carlo.

276
00:46:33 --> 00:46:39
I like when the earth moves but when it's the sky, I like a lot less!

277
00:46:37 --> 00:47:19
I like it!I think of Filippi it must be in a state!"Hello Paris, here Raoul, urgently check the insurance contract. Are we covered if the actress crashed into balloon? Hele? There is no hot air balloon in the film, there isAt the writer. Ah and then I forgot, send flowers to the 6's foot-of-offs of the agency. But do not get my old man, white roses, a lot! With a word to each to tell him that I say that I say that Ihave the role of his life. "Ah ah.Yes that's it Filippi!

278
00:47:15 --> 00:47:18
I do not want to walk we'll wait for it here?

279
00:47:27 --> 00:47:35
You knew that in the past Naples we used old lava to make love filters.

280
00:47:32 --> 00:47:35
And of course it walked all the shots?!

281
00:47:34 --> 00:47:35
It seems that yes.

282
00:47:36 --> 00:47:40
You really love them huh, your earthquakes?

283
00:47:39 --> 00:47:40
It's my life.

284
00:47:40 --> 00:47:42
And when the earth does not tremble?

285
00:47:42 --> 00:47:53
It trembles all the time.All trembles all the time: the earth, peoples, men, feelings, you too much.

286
00:47:53 --> 00:47:55
Here you!They are downstairs.

287
00:47:55 --> 00:47:58
But what takes you, you are crazy!

288
00:48:02 --> 00:48:03
Leave me alone !

289
00:48:23 --> 00:48:24
I do not like you?

290
00:48:26 --> 00:48:35
Ah, listen to you, it's cold, the night will fall, we are lost away from everything ... All this is absurd!Pff

291
00:48:47 --> 00:48:49
Stop you annoy me![XXX]

292
00:49:07 --> 00:49:10
Go you do not do it, I would say nothing

293
00:49:15 --> 00:49:22
You'll help me you'll take it in the other car, mine is a real colander.

294
00:49:20 --> 00:49:24
Hurry up, it's a time to enjoy love at first sight!

295
00:49:42 --> 00:49:49
Here, it will do you good.I always thought that the end of the world would start with a storm.

296
00:49:48 --> 00:49:53
Ah that, we never had the same idea of the end of the world you and me.

297
00:49:51 --> 00:50:02
When I landed here I told myself, ah it's so far from everything that even the apocalypse will take time to arrive.I am more so sure there.

298
00:50:03 --> 00:50:04
So the actress?

299
00:50:07 --> 00:50:17
Yeah classic, as soon as we found themselves alone the big game, small mines.Finally, I will not teach you that to you.

300
00:50:14 --> 00:50:14
So what ?

301
00:50:17 --> 00:50:30
So this girl is really not credible, she threw himself on me, downright.And it's just as you started.It has a little cooled.

302
00:50:32 --> 00:50:34
Remove me that!Remove me that!

303
00:50:47 --> 00:50:59
Like The Drip Drip Of The Rain Drops, When The Summer Shower Is Through, and A Voice Within Me Keeps Repeating You, You, You.NIGHT AND DAY ...

304
00:51:06 --> 00:51:07
Ah, here they are!

305
00:51:09 --> 00:51:11
I bring them back to you!Safe and sound.

306
00:51:16 --> 00:51:18
It's raining as long as it really?

307
00:51:20 --> 00:51:23
I hope that one day you will have the [xxx]

308
00:51:23 --> 00:51:25
Later Filippi later!

309
00:51:26 --> 00:51:37
Another 5 minutes and I sent a fax in Paris to make you replace!Because like you I have 550 at the office door!

310
00:51:32 --> 00:51:37
He who he has not yet understood that we did not even have the phone.

311
00:51:34 --> 00:51:37
I tell you that the balloon crashed

312
00:51:37 --> 00:51:38
You disgust me!

313
00:51:37 --> 00:51:39
What do you take?

314
00:51:39 --> 00:51:42
She rose on him before our eyes!

315
00:51:48 --> 00:51:52
Wasp, now the storm, tell me you are spoiled.

316
00:51:55 --> 00:52:05
You stayed a crazy time on this beach, how was it?You if I did not despise you I would make you hunt by my husband!

317
00:52:04 --> 00:52:10
I imagine you know everything about old laves and love filters.

318
00:52:16 --> 00:52:18
Keep I give you this.

319
00:52:18 --> 00:52:26
These waves, wind, it was indeed very impressive.But I must say that Carlo has been very brave.

320
00:52:23 --> 00:52:26
She was sent in the air with Carlo

321
00:52:24 --> 00:52:24
Very gallant.

322
00:52:25 --> 00:52:26
This slut.

323
00:52:32 --> 00:52:35
She threw her neck in a cave.

324
00:52:37 --> 00:52:41
Carlo told me everything is very extravagant.

325
00:52:39 --> 00:52:42
Oh, please do not talk about it.

326
00:52:41 --> 00:52:46
But if, on the contrary, I like women who have temperament.

327
00:52:43 --> 00:52:47
Yes, but there was too much, I could have been more measured.

328
00:52:48 --> 00:53:01
It's very bold on the contrary.Mathilde did things like that.Besides, I will make you a confidence, it is a scene that almost was in the novel.

329
00:52:57 --> 00:52:59
I think it's starting to walk!

330
00:52:59 --> 00:53:02
Excuse me tell you anything!

331
00:53:01 --> 00:53:07
Well, if this mishap brings me closer to Mathilde, that's that console me.

332
00:53:04 --> 00:53:10
Do not talk about consolation I know Carlo, tonight it will be another man.

333
00:53:09 --> 00:53:09
So much the better !

334
00:53:10 --> 00:53:12
It makes you so pleasure that that?

335
00:53:12 --> 00:53:18
Come, we will make you run a bath.You need to warm up.

336
00:53:20 --> 00:53:26
[XXX] was right, she threw himself at her neck, tonight she will be in her bed.

337
00:53:22 --> 00:53:26
Well, you're happy, you finally have the subject of your novel.

338
00:54:18 --> 00:54:24
VAMPE, SEX, Little girl, huh from you what woman does he want tonight?

339
00:54:30 --> 00:54:33
So like that you slept with him.

340
00:54:33 --> 00:54:33
Who he?

341
00:54:34 --> 00:54:34
Bah Carlo.

342
00:54:36 --> 00:54:44
Do you think I did not understand?Love filters, laughs in hot air balloon, beach, rain.

343
00:54:43 --> 00:54:44
Ah, but it's absurd!

344
00:54:48 --> 00:54:50
I forbid you laugh!

345
00:54:50 --> 00:54:56
Finally if I'm here, it's, it's for the film, the rest, I do not care about the rest.

346
00:54:54 --> 00:55:09
I do not care about your movie, she spoiled my life like that your Mathilde.Now what I want is Carlo and I warn you if you approach it again, I kill you.

347
00:55:02 --> 00:55:06
It's ridiculous, there we are really in full misunderstanding!

348
00:55:06 --> 00:55:12
There has never been misunderstanding and I know what you have in your head.

349
00:55:13 --> 00:55:24
Take Alexander, he is alone, he is unhappy.But let Carlo Quiet anyway he can not love a girl like you.

350
00:55:22 --> 00:55:23
If you knew.

351
00:55:55 --> 00:55:59
Dear friend did I tell you for your role?

352
00:55:57 --> 00:55:59
It's not the Filippi moment.

353
00:55:59 --> 00:56:09
We look for a new head, a beautiful little mouth but that would not have served yet.Your kind what but 30 years ago.

354
00:56:04 --> 00:56:07
I tell you it's not the Filippi moment.

355
00:56:06 --> 00:56:13
And the press, did you see the press?The former revolutionary, the personal friend of Ho Chi Minh ...

356
00:56:10 --> 00:56:13
I tell you it's not the moment Filippi!

357
00:56:13 --> 00:56:15
... agrees to wear in the cinema ...

358
00:56:14 --> 00:56:15
Let it go !

359
00:56:16 --> 00:56:26
Shit, frankly I understand nothing about this guy and it spoils there, do something.In addition the amery is against us.

360
00:56:22 --> 00:56:30
Your tricks, your strategies, you are completely next to the plate.Do not feel the atmosphere?

361
00:56:26 --> 00:56:30
Wait, I have an idea, put the disk dress.

362
00:56:29 --> 00:56:36
Yellow bikini?The gown of the dismakery, but listen to it's grotesque all that!Then what again?

363
00:56:33 --> 00:56:41
But it's written in the book.And in the lousy, I'm sorry he has flashed, he was like crazy!

364
00:56:38 --> 00:56:51
I point out that the Aztecs could predict eclipses, earthquakes and love sorrows.It was not their job, I drink aztecs.

365
00:56:50 --> 00:56:56
You are right, especially since it was not scientists, it was poets.

366
00:56:55 --> 00:56:56
I drink poetry!

367
00:56:58 --> 00:57:03
I believe our friends are bored.We should organize something.

368
00:57:06 --> 00:57:14
I can not stand that my friends are bored.I drink at friendship.All the world is not bored here.

369
00:57:23 --> 00:57:24
You're welcome.

370
00:57:25 --> 00:57:49
How? 'Or' What ?Do not feel these vibrations, these emotions?These little hearts that are panicked?These sensations?These love filters?I drink to love.Then, since it seems to be the day, I will make a statement.Arianne come here, you're my wife after all.Let's go there is no reason.

371
00:58:03 --> 00:58:03
Stopped.

372
00:58:05 --> 00:58:06
I drink to my wife.

373
00:58:08 --> 00:58:08
Stopped.

374
00:58:14 --> 00:58:17
Stop I told you, I hate dancing.

375
00:58:17 --> 00:58:19
But you once liked!

376
00:58:31 --> 00:58:42
But what did I do to the end?What do you want ?Is it my fault to me if you want to write more?It's my fault ?

377
00:58:42 --> 00:58:42
Leave me !

378
00:58:43 --> 00:58:44
Your fault !

379
00:58:44 --> 00:58:44
Leave me !

380
00:58:55 --> 00:58:56
Your fault !

381
00:58:46 --> 00:58:46
Leave me !

382
00:58:50 --> 00:58:50
Argh!Ah

383
00:59:23 --> 00:59:25
Favorite![XXX] al es dies.

384
01:00:06 --> 01:00:09
Do not touch it small!You could hurt you!

385
01:00:09 --> 01:00:12
I do not need it to me, I'm banging!

386
01:00:16 --> 01:00:21
But you cry.But I told you.Do not go into his game.

387
01:00:57 --> 01:01:00
Tonight I will not sleep on my boat!

388
01:01:00 --> 01:01:00
Because ?

389
01:01:01 --> 01:01:09
Because it's the full moon!And Cristobal, he never sleeps on a boat the nights of full moon.

390
01:01:09 --> 01:01:13
Ah, but you already believe you at the first film?

391
01:01:12 --> 01:01:14
Ah the first, you will see!

392
01:01:16 --> 01:01:19
It's good Filippi, earn time!

393
01:01:18 --> 01:01:20
I was going to offer it to you.

394
01:01:20 --> 01:01:22
Your movie I do not want it.

395
01:01:23 --> 01:01:23
What ?

396
01:01:24 --> 01:01:27
You heard me, I do not sign.

397
01:01:26 --> 01:01:32
Bah, I do not understand you anymore.You said that you hesitate but from there to ...

398
01:01:30 --> 01:01:32
Oh it's simple!

399
01:01:31 --> 01:01:32
... do not sign.

400
01:01:33 --> 01:01:50
You almost convinced me, this novel that it was necessary not to defile, this small plot of Innocence that I wanted to preserve.You were right, it was not going far, especially when you need money.

401
01:01:46 --> 01:01:46
Ah, then?

402
01:01:48 --> 01:01:58
So, something happened this afternoon, something stupid.Say, it's interesting your full moon story.

403
01:02:02 --> 01:02:07
Indeed, it's very interesting but I would still like to know me ...

404
01:02:04 --> 01:02:19
What happened this afternoon, oh it's simple.I went to recover on a deserted beach a girl and a guy who had 30 years less than me.It's all beast huh.

405
01:02:22 --> 01:02:28
Stop with that!I'm sure she did not sleep with him, not true Lucien?

406
01:02:27 --> 01:02:35
From the FUCK it would not be the first time we have a little con in the pasta to fuck us.

407
01:02:32 --> 01:02:35
Mass me Lucien's shoulders I'm tired.

408
01:02:36 --> 01:02:58
I will tell you, what I liked in your business is that you offered me to relive my youth and to do as if everything could start again.All.Love, books, money, glory, life what.And what I understood is that it does not work like that.

409
01:03:01 --> 01:03:14
Oh, but if that's it, it can work out.Laure is possessed you hear me, owned by the character, so by you.And yet, it makes me happy than half.

410
01:03:14 --> 01:03:48
This is not Filippi, I just understood and that you can not do anything, we can not improve his own resurection.When it's over, it's over.There is even a little obscenity to claim an extension cord.So you want to make a movie about the story of my life?It's not worth it, they do it there they film the full moon nights.They have amazing actors.And it seems that the scenario holds off.

411
01:03:57 --> 01:03:57
-

412
01:06:22 --> 01:06:24
Do you know what would you do good?

413
01:06:25 --> 01:06:27
Nothing would do me good.

414
01:06:27 --> 01:06:28
Why do you say that ?

415
01:06:31 --> 01:06:33
Because I'm already dead

416
01:06:32 --> 01:06:34
What are you talking about ?

417
01:06:38 --> 01:07:02
You know Cristobal, the writers, they do not die like everyone else.Sometimes they die too early, sometimes they die just on time.After dragging until the last line, the last page, their last book.And then they are just curbing at the moment they have nothing to say.

418
01:07:05 --> 01:07:06
It's [xxx]

419
01:07:08 --> 01:07:29
And then there are others, most, it pretends to live, 5, 10 years older.It writes more a line, it pulls on his memories as an old bank account, until they realize that it is the source that is so dry, completely dry.

420
01:07:31 --> 01:07:32
Come on, a drink.

421
01:07:39 --> 01:07:42
Why is he still here?

422
01:07:42 --> 01:07:45
If I bother you, you can go.

423
01:07:46 --> 01:07:49
Do not worry, I'm going tomorrow morning.

424
01:07:50 --> 01:07:52
Tomorrow morning, are you sure?

425
01:07:53 --> 01:08:06
And yes little, I'm sure but you know what would me please see, it would still be to break the mouth once before leaving.You do not mind ?

426
01:08:08 --> 01:08:21
Cristobal, we will play it differently.It's been months that I have more boxed it will relax.Would you like to make a round, just to laugh like that?I will not call.

427
01:08:22 --> 01:08:24
In the state where you are?

428
01:08:28 --> 01:08:35
It's been 30 years that I train and you jamai put the gloves, so you see, we are left.

429
01:08:37 --> 01:08:41
Do as usual!And warns everyone!

430
01:09:03 --> 01:09:11
You have seen ?He gave Carlo the gloves that I offered him.How do I have to take it?

431
01:09:17 --> 01:09:18
It excites you?

432
01:10:13 --> 01:10:13
-

433
01:10:51 --> 01:10:52
I'm pitying you?

434
01:10:52 --> 01:10:52
But no

435
01:10:53 --> 01:10:53
Oh, ah, ah

436
01:11:21 --> 01:11:36
All this is no longer your age!Ah I remember when you broke the mouth of this guy who had written that you had style but no balls!It was happening wherever?

437
01:11:30 --> 01:11:30
Paris, 1975

438
01:11:34 --> 01:13:01
Rue du Bac, yes. 2 direct, Han Han. Ah of the real work of champion, huh? There was more criticism to dare to say a word through your service states. It was a good time ! As 10 years ago. Just before we left when you had demolished this shitty who had dropped on a TV tray that if you change all the woman's time is that you write more your books. We must be there, all this is the past, you no longer breath or legs. As with the rest at the bottom. From you to me, why did we go huh? Well, I know the official version: the great writer withdraws, he takes leave of the world, he leaves to write his masterpiece with the eyes fixed on eternity. But the truth is that you feel that the season was over, had to pass the hand. It's already nice to have held 30 years. And even 40 if you count your first period when you were a match. Look, I did not even have a season at all, always in your shadow. Do I mind?

439
01:12:41 --> 01:12:44
You write not bad either, you talent.

440
01:12:44 --> 01:13:29
Can be, but now see where I am, secretary of a writer who does not write.Condemned to classify old papers, to sort of the courier that arrives more.Still a little when you have no more money to pay petite it's me who should iron your shirts, so all that to say that I have a tip to give you: curtain, fire extinction, we stopto believe that we could resuscitate.So now there is this film story.What are you going to do in this galley to play with your memories or with actresses.

441
01:13:25 --> 01:13:28
Oh, bah women is not your thing.

442
01:13:28 --> 01:14:02
This girl, she makes you beat my heart, I saw well.But she is there for what?She comes to sniff the animal, pocket her share of legend, because it would be not bad to have been the last woman who made Bander Alexander.And then she will leave, because you have to ask too much and there is not a woman in the world who would get here between you and me, humm?You have already lost Arianne.

443
01:13:56 --> 01:13:58
I did everything for you know it.

444
01:13:58 --> 01:14:21
Yeah, but suppose that the actress is running too when she realized that we are stinking.We will be both, like cons in this country of savages where it trembles everywhere.Here, I speak like Carlo now.But on that notice it is not wrong and we can not do anything.

445
01:14:16 --> 01:14:34
It's true lucien except that this woman you see it's something other than all the small who turned around for me to put them in a novel, I understood right away, as soon as I have itI saw, it scared me.

446
01:14:27 --> 01:14:29
You dream but if it arranges you.

447
01:14:29 --> 01:14:38
No, this girl is not only the actress who will play Mathilde, it's his model you understand?His model.

448
01:14:35 --> 01:14:42
Ah, stop with your Mathilde, since we know each other you inflate me with this slut.

449
01:14:40 --> 01:15:18
Even you do not know who the True Mathilde, she made me suffer like a damned.I realize today that she was the draft of this woman I saw this morning for the first time and that I have the impression to know forever.Her gaze earlier after this ridiculous match, her way out of the water, her hands, this [xxx] when after misunderstanding her in front of everyone she invented this wasp sting story.

450
01:15:15 --> 01:15:17
Are you still there Lucien?

451
01:15:18 --> 01:15:18
Yes.

452
01:15:22 --> 01:15:23
Give me a cigarette.

453
01:15:32 --> 01:15:33
You were there too?

454
01:15:56 --> 01:16:04
Besame, Besame Mucho, Como If Fuera Esta Noche the ùltima Vez, Besame, Besame Mucho, that Tengo Miedo ...

455
01:17:05 --> 01:17:05
-

456
01:18:11 --> 01:18:15
Shut up shut up, I think.

457
01:18:18 --> 01:18:25
You do not worry my darling, Alexander is still in absurd situations.

458
01:18:25 --> 01:18:25
Leave me.

459
01:18:26 --> 01:18:37
It's because you think you're going to have to leave that's right?And that you will be able to come back, and it makes you suffer.But I'm leaving with you.

460
01:18:32 --> 01:18:33
Fools me the camp!

461
01:18:36 --> 01:18:38
But what's wrong?

462
01:18:38 --> 01:18:46
Nothing !I have nothing to fuck of this boxing match, I have nothing to fuck your husband, leave me!

463
01:18:46 --> 01:18:46
And me ?

464
01:18:47 --> 01:18:51
And me ?And me if I?You really understood nothing.

465
01:18:57 --> 01:18:58
You never loved me?

466
01:18:58 --> 01:19:04
If maybe, at first, when you've arrived.It was so beautiful.

467
01:19:09 --> 01:19:11
So what do you want ?

468
01:19:10 --> 01:19:26
Nothing !I even know who I am, I know even more what I have to do.You have made me a revolutionary living room, a grotesque puppet.Do you think they do not know others?

469
01:19:32 --> 01:19:32
My dear.

470
01:19:33 --> 01:19:42
Do not call me "my darling"!You make me pity, pity with your, your clothes to con when you make the ball.

471
01:19:45 --> 01:19:45
Corn !

472
01:19:46 --> 01:19:53
You make pity when you pretend to enjoy!You make mercy with your grotesque surprises!

473
01:19:51 --> 01:19:51
Shut your mouth !

474
01:19:52 --> 01:19:53
You make me pity !

475
01:20:06 --> 01:20:16
What am I doing now huh?What do you think I have to do?It's more your problem.Like a rat!

476
01:20:14 --> 01:20:30
You know why I chose this corner of Mexico?Because there is here a tribe of Indians who believes that every man born twice in the same life.And that his true birth is the second.

477
01:20:30 --> 01:20:31
I like this idea.

478
01:20:34 --> 01:20:42
So you see, here you come, you came and then the old Indians were right, but what time lost.

479
01:20:48 --> 01:20:53
It's my fault, I should have come earlier, I wanted you know?

480
01:20:56 --> 01:21:17
It's not serious.It does not matter since I will write them now all those books that escaped me as sand between the fingers.It's strange, is not it?You were coming to revive my first novel and maybe you will inspire the last.

481
01:21:27 --> 01:21:28
What are you thinking about ?

482
01:21:31 --> 01:21:39
I think of a girl who has just been 20 years old and who has dropped her number at the theater.

483
01:21:41 --> 01:21:41
So what ?

484
01:21:48 --> 01:22:40
So, one night after the show, a famous writer comes behind the scenes, he is surrounded by his yard, the photographers mitrame.He distributes his compliments, each receives them as a blessing and when he arrives near the young actress, he looks strangely, she is troubled, she blushes, he does not even ask her his name and just before hegives him the pen with whom he signed autographs."Hold" he di-he is with that I wrote under the bombs in Hanoi.The next day, I read in the newspaper that you had a whole stock, that you distributed them as soon as a girl pleased you.

485
01:22:44 --> 01:22:46
So, I already saw you.

486
01:22:46 --> 01:22:59
You changed my life, this pen you gave to everyone, he never left me!As if one day had to give you something to write.

487
01:23:09 --> 01:23:10
Besame Mucho

488
01:23:21 --> 01:23:25
You really leave tomorrow?I have to make your suitcase?

489
01:23:23 --> 01:23:30
I have to leave and very early!Cristobal right now, it makes business very special.

490
01:23:35 --> 01:23:47
The walk tired Mr. Filippi.He needs a good night!And your project that knows?There are many things that can happen tonight.

491
01:23:47 --> 01:23:55
Sonia is right, she knows me well.Mr. Filippi I came to tell you that we will do this movie.

492
01:23:58 --> 01:24:02
Ah, I see that Laure has convinced you.Very well.

493
01:24:02 --> 01:24:05
And do not worry, I will not change any reviews.

494
01:24:13 --> 01:24:20
But it's my friend Carlo who leaves us!Come CARLO, come, are you going to leave like that?

495
01:24:22 --> 01:24:53
You see you made a mistake.No, no it's not to have knocked me earlier, I had drunk.It is not to play the revolutionaries in room with carnival guerrillas.The revolutions of [xxx] I know that better than you, it's more complicated than the machines to go back in time.It's not to be inlaid here for 5 years and having slept with my wife.

496
01:24:49 --> 01:24:50
I do not allow you

497
01:24:50 --> 01:25:04
Shut up!You are not lovers, you are my Marionettes, no, what's wrong with it's what you tried to make me believe earlier in the car.

498
01:25:00 --> 01:25:01
I did not know.

499
01:25:01 --> 01:25:15
I do not care what you knew because this lie, this way of making me believe that you and Laure, huh, you see that, I do not want to forgive you.

500
01:25:44 --> 01:26:09
This is an earthquake that you had not planned for my friend.And pis did not think for a touch either, you think I did not know what you plotted in the village with your pistolleros and your girlfriend.Come on, he leaves 6 hours his boat, at 6 o'clock!Course quickly tell them!You're dying!

501
01:26:09 --> 01:26:11
That's good, we finally won.

502
01:26:11 --> 01:26:13
Yes, but I ask you forgiveness.

503
01:26:14 --> 01:26:20
But no, anyway I never thought you could like a guy like me.

504
01:26:19 --> 01:26:25
But, yes, I was a little used for you, this film actually, I did not care.

505
01:26:29 --> 01:26:34
Usually it's producers who use actresses, but there.

506
01:26:34 --> 01:26:45
I love you a lot, I'll never forget what you have done for me.No never.Even if you did not really do it for me.

507
01:27:47 --> 01:27:52
It's not serious.It does not matter, it happens to everyone.

508
01:28:33 --> 01:28:42
It does not matter, Hin Hin is not serious, it does not matter, it does not matter, it does not matter, it does not matter!

509
01:29:20 --> 01:29:42
Come on to wake up!Oh !You know that Alexander does not like when you come to his office.It may not be my stuff but I see that the day is hurting for you.More Alexander, more Carlo, Pfft, Uh, do you want a coffee?

510
01:30:15 --> 01:30:16
Carlo, Carlo.

511
01:30:49 --> 01:31:52
Come on, it does not make sense.Do you remember that type I had introduced you to Paris?He said, it made you laugh, "We always suicide too late".What could he become?I think he died in his bed like everyone else.Do not cry, you're for nothing.It was me who was wrong 10 years ago by believing that there is always a moment when a writer must withdraw, live on his reserves and finally write the book that would only come out of him.All the misfortune came from there.I found myself as a fish on the sand and it is my poor darling that stifled in my place.You did what you could.What can we do when we find each morning a guy who will spend his day reproaching his forfeiture?

512
01:31:54 --> 01:31:56
All this does not matter anymore.

513
01:31:56 --> 01:32:08
In any case do not worry, Laure will wait for a few days at Cristobal.It was Sonia who held there for regard for you, you know her.

514
01:32:06 --> 01:32:07
I do not worry.

515
01:32:11 --> 01:32:27
And then after, I think I'll go back to Paris, I'm sudden enough.This girl, I'll explain you one day.What do I have left?10 years, 5 years?I want to pass them with her.

516
01:32:36 --> 01:32:39
And me ? What am I going to become ?

517
01:32:39 --> 01:32:47
Do you want me to tell you ?Carlo, as soon as I have left this house, I'm sure he will come back.

518
01:32:43 --> 01:32:43
You think ?

519
01:32:45 --> 01:32:48
Yeah !In a novel I will bring it back.

520
01:32:59 --> 01:33:03
Mrs. Sonia decided.Ms. Sonia has always decided here?

521
01:33:12 --> 01:33:16
But I will come back a day.Mr. Gusta Tanto Aqui!

522
01:34:31 --> 01:34:36
Do not forget when you go up the anchor, the 3 pistol strokes!

523
01:34:34 --> 01:34:41
And you, Maestro, do not forget to answer me.Today is the Fantasia of hell!

524
01:34:35 --> 01:34:41
I will take the hot air balloon and if the winds help me a little, I will follow you.

525
01:36:36 --> 01:36:42
Mathilde, so it was she?You knew it is not it?You knew it all.

526
01:37:57 --> 01:37:59
Monte little, goes up, he will help you.

527
01:38:01 --> 01:38:04
Do you think he'll see us from there?

528
01:38:03 --> 01:38:06
You will have all the life to see it.

529
01:38:07 --> 01:38:08
Ha ha ha ha.

530
01:38:09 --> 01:38:09
Gracias

531
01:39:14 --> 01:39:16
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

532
01:39:49 --> 01:39:52
Come on !Mr. Filippi, the movie!

533
01:40:31 --> 01:40:32
Ha ha ha ha ha, oh!

534
01:40:35 --> 01:40:36
Senor, Senor!

535
01:40:40 --> 01:40:42
Do you talk about now?

536
01:41:08 --> 01:41:08
No ! No !
